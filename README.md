# pic1d1v-HPC
This repository houses a high-performance Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code that simulates a plasma from a kinetic perspective. This is in contrast to a fluid point of view where the plasma is viewed as a continuum that is governed explicitly by a set of conservation laws. For an explanation of the PIC algorithm, see the texts, *Plasma Physics via Computer Simulation* or *Computer Simulation Using Particles*. The file located in this directory, "The-PIC-Algorithm.pdf", describes the code that is implemented here. 

# Current Tasks

# A Competition Among Programming Languages 
In addition to the original code implemented in C++, versions of the code implemented in Fortran, Python, Rust, Julia, and C are being developed in the respective folders for the purpose of comparing the performance of the different languages.
