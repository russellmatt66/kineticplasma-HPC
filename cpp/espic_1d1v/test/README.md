# Overview
Tests and miscellaneous utility scripts for writing the report, and validating the code.

# Validation
Here are the cases to run to validate the code:
(1) Electron motion
- Show the correct oscillatory motion of a pair of electrons in phasespace

(2) Langmuir Waves
- Show the correct behavior of a population of electrons

# Tests
Here are the modules that still need testing:

(1) Charge-weighting 
- Basically, test that the binary search works

(2) Field Solve
- Compare output with various analytical solutions

# Directory Structure
ParticleShape/
- Visualizes shape functions up to 6th-order using discrete convolution
