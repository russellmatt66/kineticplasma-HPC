Tests and miscellaneous utility scripts.

# Tests
Here are the modules that still need testing:

(1) Charge-weighting 
- Basically, test that the binary search works

(2) Field Solve
- Compare output with various analytical solutions

# Directory Structure
ParticleShape/
- Visualizes shape functions up to 6th-order using discrete convolution

BinarySearch/
- Test findParticle()

PoissonSolve/
- Test FieldSolveMatrix()
